# Beginner Javascript Projects

I want to better understand frontend development and in the next few months I am going to create some basic plain JS projects to improve my kwnowledge. I will be posting the projects in this repository in separate folders. I do not have a fixed list of projects, I will pick and choose the projects from the web that seem interesting and useful for my learning.
